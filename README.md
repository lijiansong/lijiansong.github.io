This archive is my technological blog site w.r.t. the summary of a certain stage of my work & study.

For more details see [here...](http://lijiansong.github.io)

Postscript:
This archive will be updated irregularly.

## Notice

The site used to be built with Middleman [[1]](#middleman) and its blog plugin [[6]](#middleman_blog), a static website
generator [[2]](#static_gen).

I rewrite the website deployment and generation by switching to some custom Python code,
but it is still a static website generator. It uses markdown [[7]](#markdown) for posting, jinja2 [[5]](#jinja2)
templates and SASS [[4]](#SASS). Pygments [[3]](#pygments) is used for syntax highlighting,
which is similar to jekyll [[8]](#jekyll) theme syntax highlighting.

Thanks for [Gabriel's](gabriel.corona@enst-bretagne.fr.) theme, very nice and clean.
