Numerous life trivial needs to be done, such as purchasing house and living things, going through all the formalities, and etc.</p> <p>The whole year's work depends on a good start. Since I am studying for a doctor's degree, I need to develop all kinds of ability to improve myself, such as</p> <ul> <li>the ability to lead a team. I always insist that the difference between doctor and master is that a doctor has enough time to develop his or her team-leading ability. A new problem comes, a doctor is supposed to be clear about it, and guide his team to solve it in a short time.</li> <li>the ability of programming. I also believe that a doctor's programming ability should be no less than a master's.</li> <li>the capacity for scientific resaerch. A doctor should keep him updated about the latest development on his domain, and be clear about its strengths and weaknesses.</li> </ul> <p>Actions speak louder than words. This year I have to learn some basic knowledge on <strong>distributed computing, compilation technology and data mining</strong>. Numerous books need to be read.</p> <ul> <li>Spark...</li> <li>Hadoop...</li> <li>Storm...</li> <li>Kafka...</li> <li>Docker...</li> <li>Mahout...</li> </ul> <p>Besides the above, I also have to spare some time to get a driver license. I also want to take part in some programming contest, such as <strong>ACM/ICPC, or CCPC</strong>, and etc, which are very interesting.</p> <p><strong>MAN, CHEER UP!</strong></p> <p><a href=http://www.pgbovine.net/PhD-memoir/pguo-PhD-grind.pdf>THE PH.D GRIND</a></p> </article> </section> </main> <footer> <form action=https://duckduckgo.com/ role=search> <input type=hidden name=sites value=lijiansong.github.io> <input type=hidden name=kae value=-1 id=_ddg_theme> <input role=searchbox name=q aria-label=Search placeholder="Search with DuckDuckGo..."> <button type=submit>Search</button> </form> <p><small> <a href=/about/ >About</a> - Powered by <a lang=fr href=https://github.com/middleman/middleman>Middleman</a> and <a href=https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome>Font-Awesome</a> - <a href="mailto:lijiansong AT ict DOT ac DOT cn?subject=[Comment for http://github.com/lijiansong/2016/09/03/2016-study-plan/]">Q & A</a> </small></p> </footer> <script src=/js/main.js></script> </body> </html>
