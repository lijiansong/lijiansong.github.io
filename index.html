<p>This archive is the integral architecture design of the engine, which is like a library manager. Not only can it manager the opencv libs, but also it is able to manage any other libs, such as <em>face detection, voice recognition</em> and so on. </p>

<h2>
<a id="aidl-service-client" class="anchor" href="#aidl-service-client" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>AIDL Service Client</h2>

<p>The AIDL Service Client is based on AIDL (Android Interface Definition Language) which is similar to other IDLs you might have worked with. It allows you to define the programming interface that both the client and service agree upon in order to communicate with each other using interprocess communication (IPC) which is based on the underlying <em>Binder</em> mechanisms.</p>

<h3>
<a id="modules" class="anchor" href="#modules" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Modules</h3>

<p>The technical architecture of the AIDL Service Client is shown below.</p>

<h3>
<a id="benefits" class="anchor" href="#benefits" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Benefits</h3>

<p>As we can see from the above picture, it is obvious that the AIDL Service Client has the following benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>Less memory usage. All apps use the same binaries from service and do not have to keep the native libs inside themselves;</li>
<li>Hardware specific optimizations for all supported platforms, such as the different CPU-Arch of Android platform;</li>
<li>Once the Engine is released, all the Service Libraries will be trusted library source. All packages with OpenCV should be published on Google Play market or Apple's App Store;</li>
<li>Regular updates and bug fixes.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a id="code-generator" class="anchor" href="#code-generator" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Code Generator</h2>

<p>Besides the AIDL Service Client, the engine also contains a code generator. The code generator is based on the description file (config file), which is composed of infomation of the native libs. The information in the config file contains the usage of the libs, therefore the code generator is able to generate code automatically with the assistance of the config files. </p>

<h3>
<a id="features" class="anchor" href="#features" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Features</h3>

<ul>
<li>Generating code automatically. So it can spare the trouble of learning new programing language and coding the app oneself;</li>
<li>Cross-platorm. Since the description file is light-weighted, the code generator can perform normally on mutiple platforms;</li>
<li>Automatical lib-packageing. Taking full advantage of the libs to develop various applications, the code generator should have the function of packaging the libiaries automatically. For example, we have class A and class B, both of them have many member functions, the code generator can <em>combine(package)</em> these functions together to get a new class for different development purposes so that developers can call these functions more easily.</li>
</ul>
