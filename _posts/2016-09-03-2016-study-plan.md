  The whole year's work depends on a good start. Since I am studying for a doctor's degree, I need to develop all kinds of ability to improve myself, such as

- the ability to lead a team. I always insist that the difference between doctor and master is that a doctor has enough time to develop his or her team-leading ability. A new problem comes, a doctor is supposed to be clear about it, and guide his team to solve it in a short time.
- the ability of programming. I also believe that a doctor's programming ability should be no less than a master's.
- the capacity for scientific resaerch. A doctor should keep him updated about the latest development on his domain, and be clear about its strengths and weaknesses.

Actions speak louder than words. This year I have to learn some basic knowledge on **distributed computing, compilation technology and data mining**.
Numerous books need to be read.

- Spark...
- Hadoop...
- Storm...
- Kafka...
- Docker...
- Mahout...

Besides the above, I also have to spare some time to get a driver license.
I also want to take part in some programming contest, such as **ACM/ICPC, or CCPC**, and etc, which are very interesting.

**MAN, CHEER UP!**
