  It has been a long day since new term begins. Numerous life trivial needs to be done, such as purchasing house and living things, going through all the formalities, and etc.

<p><!-- more --></p>

<p>The whole year’s work depends on a good start. Since I am studying for a doctor’s degree, I need to develop all kinds of ability to improve myself, such as</p>

<ul>
  <li>the ability to lead a team. I always insist that the difference between doctor and master is that a doctor has enough time to develop his or her team-leading ability. A new problem comes, a doctor is supposed to be clear about it, and guide his team to solve it in a short time.</li>
  <li>the ability of programming. I also believe that a doctor’s programming ability should be no less than a master’s.</li>
  <li>the capacity for scientific resaerch. A doctor should keep him updated about the latest development on his domain, and be clear about its strengths and weaknesses.</li>
</ul>

<p>Actions speak louder than words. This year I have to learn some basic knowledge on <strong>distributed computing, compilation technology and data mining</strong>.
Numerous books need to be read.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Spark…</li>
  <li>Hadoop…</li>
  <li>Storm…</li>
  <li>Kafka…</li>
  <li>Docker…</li>
  <li>Mahout…</li>
</ul>

<p>Besides the above, I also have to spare some time to get a driver license.
I also want to take part in some programming contest, such as <strong>ACM/ICPC, or CCPC</strong>, and etc, which are very interesting.</p>

<p><strong>MAN, CHEER UP!</strong></p>
