NDArray is short for N Dimension Array, it is a headers only library for N-Dimensions array(i.e. tensor in deep learning) expressions, such as arithmatic operations, reshape, reduction, slice and etc.

## Relevant Research

In deep learning applications, tensor can be seen everywhere[[7]](#taco_pr). It is necessary to wrap its operations to lower the difficulty and cost for application developers.

Eigen[[1]](#eigen_repo)[[2]](#eigen_page) is a C++ template library for linear algebra: matrices, vectors, numerical solvers, and related algorithms. It has been applied into many open-source project, e.g. [TensorFlow](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow) and etc. Its implementation is template meta programming[[3]](#wiki_meta) based and its expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable `lazy evaluation`, when that is appropriate[[4]](#eigen_lazy). 

TACO(Tensor Algebra Compiler)[[6]](#taco_page)is a C++ library that computes tensor algebra expressions on sparse and dense tensors. It uses novel compiler techniques to get performance competitive with hand-optimized kernels in widely used libraries for both sparse tensor algebra and sparse linear algebra.

## NDArray Key Features

Many C++11 new features has been applied during its implementation, e.g. Rvalue references, variadic templates, initializer lists, type traits and etc. Some of its design concept comes from C++ STL container and Eigen tensor[[5]](#eigen_tensor).

- NDArray is versatile. It provides much flexibility, since its implementation is `template meta programming` based. It supports all standard numeric types, and any dimension NDArrays.
- NDArray will provide both `static and dynamic` containers.
- To guarantee performance, NDArray expression templates allow to intelligently remove temporaries and enable `lazy evaluation`. And I will try to take use of SIMD instructions for CPU, GPU or some ASIC platforms.
